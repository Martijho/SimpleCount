# Simple Count
This is a simple android widget which keeps track of a count. 
The design requirements for this widget is as follows: 
1. To have a simple widget which displays a number, a progress bar and the difference between the number and some target.
2. To be able to add to the current total with as few clicks as possible
3. To be able to change the target number easily
4. To be able to reset the count back to 0 easily
5. To have a short history of the added values.

My primary use for this app is to be able to keep track of calori intake with as few steps as possible, 
minimizing the hassle of doing so every day.
